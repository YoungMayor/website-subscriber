# Website Subscriber Demo App

Welcome to the Laravel Website Subscriber Repository! This is a brief guide to help you get started with running the code on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- PHP >= 8.2
- Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP)
- MySQL (or any other supported database)
- Git (Version control system)

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laravel-project.git
```

- Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd laravel-project
```

- Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

- Create a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Generate a new application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

- Update the `.env` file with your database credentials.

- Run database migrations to create tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```


## Usage
To run the Laravel application on your local server, use the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You can now access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Additional Information
- You may need to configure your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to serve the Laravel application if you prefer not to use the built-in PHP server.
- For more detailed documentation on Laravel, visit Laravel Official Documentation.
- Feel free to explore the routes, controllers, models, and views directories to understand the structure of the application.
